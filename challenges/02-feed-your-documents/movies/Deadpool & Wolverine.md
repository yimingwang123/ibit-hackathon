Theres not much of a plot and the villains weren't that great. It was a good laugh though and amazing cameos and fight scenes.

Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!

There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.

Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters with a great showing.

As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ is the best there has been since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It’s two hours of comic book-driven fan service and delivers entertaining surprises, nostalgic throwbacks, memorable action sequences, and worthwhile performances.

In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily. And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.

Such a fun watch, maybe one of the best experiences I've had in a theater. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to 24 year old franchise.

Well the "Deadpool" concept is now well and truly immersed in the multi-verse and I really did fear for good old "Dead". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed "Wolverine/Logan" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing "Paradox" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down "Cassandra Nova" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of "Xavier" who presides over the void. That's a "Mad Max" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by "Paradox" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.

Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe has been needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases.

Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the universe that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous movies.

The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.

Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.

This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the established tone.

Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.

It feels a bit rushed... but then it was rushed.  It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.

The thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for "Not Being Gay Enough" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: "They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it." Which, in turn, translates to "Actually entertaining."

It's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.

Only.... it's meh.  I mean, when you compare it to most of the movies this year it's pretty epic.  When you compare it to most of the post 2016 movies this is one of the greatest things ever made... but when you compare it to the other Deadpool movies it's rushed.

But... who cares, it literally doesn't have a point other than entertaining you, and that is really all that matters and all that I ask for.

Is it a cash grab? Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.

So when a movie like this comes along, it is a wonderful thing.

Satisfying and 100% fan-service. Hugh Jackman still is awesome as Wolverine and gives it his all, along with Ryan Reynolds, both showing passion for the characters. That said, much like Deadpool 2, I'm not sure if I have much desire to revisit anytime soon. **3.5/5**

I just watched Deadpool & Wolverine, and wow, it was an absolute blast! Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have incredible chemistry that makes the whole movie work. Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's gruff seriousness balance each other perfectly. The film is packed with hilarious jokes, epic action sequences, and so many Easter eggs that comic book fans will be thrilled.

The opening sequence had me hooked right away, with a mix of intense fighting and Deadpool's signature humor. The constant fourth-wall breaks were spot-on and kept the laughs coming. It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.

If you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by. Whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on all fronts. Don't miss it!

For devout fans only.

Here is a test for franchise films: Remove the IP and characters to see if the story, character development, etc. stands on its own without using the IP as a crutch.
If you remove the IP in this case, you have absolutely nothing.

If you've seen a lot of previous films in this universe, you will be treated with an abundance of fan service. Admittedly, I have not watched a lot of these films. I have, however, watched the first two Deadpool entries. I enjoyed them at the time, especially the first one.

In this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.
This film is an almost non-stop barrage of bickering and snarky jokes, but it's never given any time at all to breathe. The few moments where it actually tries to convey emotion, it never truly lands, as all it wants to do is tell jokes. Did I laugh here and there? Sure. But I can count it on one hand.

The villain and plot quite forgettable, and you never truly feel that something's at stake, as the threat is mainly conveyed as a progress bar on a screen...

Even though some people might enjoy Deadpool taking potshots, Disney knows exactly what they're doing, and they will be laughing all the way to the bank. Corporate brand maintenance is all it is.

I went to see Deadpool & Wolverine last evening and boy did it feel refreshing to see Ryan Reynolds making all of these funny jokes on screen as Deadpool. There were a lot of mentions of comic books, jokes about production companies & about production crew/cast (extras, etc). As someone who's passionate about this industry and is very active in the business, this film is a big success in my opinion. I loved that we got to see Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan in the intro of the film, just sad we didn't get a little Tony Stark (RDJ) appearance, but hey, it's not his movie after all (RIP Iron Man).

Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.

They are back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?

Prepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.

Without giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.

While the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 

Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!

Not funny as Deadpool 1 & 2, I was expecting something smashing due to the reviews I have read and people hype in social media. The fight scenes saved the movie.

I personally enjoyed it. It was a fresh splash of the recent flops of movies. The plot was a little disorganized, but overall great film. The nostalgia and love letter to Foxfilms was a nice touch.
